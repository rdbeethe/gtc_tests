# GTC Talk: Bilateral and Trilateral Adaptive Support Weights in Stereo Vision

This code was used in the timing measurements of algorithms for a talk at the 2016 Nvidia GPU Technology Conference.

The code is also useful for testing a suite of various freely-available algorithms on your particular stereo images.

The version of my own GPU-accelerated adaptive support weight stereo matching algorithm was taken from a larger repository found at:
